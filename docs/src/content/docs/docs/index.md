Dusa is a logic programming language.

- If you've heard of Datalog (as implemented in systems like
  [Souffl√©](https://souffle-lang.github.io/program)), you may want to start by
  reading about how [Dusa is datalog](/docs/introductions/datalog/).
- If you've heard of answer set programming (as implemented in systems
  like [Potassco](https://potassco.org/)), you may want to start by reading
  about how [Dusa is answer set programming](/docs/introductions/asp/).

If you have no familarity with either of these, that's okay too! You may want
to start by reading about how [Dusa is a graph exploration
language](/docs/introductions/graph/). Then you can take a look at some of the
other guides, or [fiddle with some of the default examples](/).
