## Functional constraints

## Forbid constraints

If all the premises to any `#forbid` declaration can be simutaeously satisfied, the database
is invalidaed.

## Demand constraints

Conversely, an ostensible solution will be invalidated unless all the premises to every `#demand`
declaration can be simultaneously satisfied.
